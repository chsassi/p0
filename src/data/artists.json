    "description": "Producing from the heart of Europe, The Martens are a Slovakian-based drum & bass duo who have carved their place in the neurofunk scene with precision and power. Their release Ambush (via Drumatch Records) is recognized as a standout neurofunk cut.\n\nIn 2019 they were awarded 2nd place in the Emerging Artist category at the CZ & SK DnB Awards.\n\nTheir sound is defined by aggressive basslines, technical drum programming, and a darkly cinematic atmosphere — all of which make The Martens a natural fit for labels like Protocol Zero and the deeper side of neurofunk.",
