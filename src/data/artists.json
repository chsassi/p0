    "description": "1/2 of ProtocolZero\n\nProducing from the heart of Europe, The Martens are a Slovakian-based drum & bass duo who have carved their place in the neurofunk scene with precision and power. Their release Ambush (via Drumatch Records) is recognized as a standout neurofunk cut.\n\nIn 2019 they were awarded 2nd place in the Emerging Artist category at the CZ & SK DnB Awards.\n\nTheir sound is defined by aggressive basslines, technical drum programming, and a darkly cinematic atmosphere — all of which make The Martens a natural fit for labels like Protocol Zero and the deeper side of neurofunk.",

    "description": "The Sun Vanished (TSV) began his journey into music back in 2016, driven by his passion for street dancing and rhythm. What started as pure curiosity soon evolved into a deep creative calling. Over the years, he explored a wide range of sounds and genres, constantly searching for his own identity in music.\n\nThat search led him to the Japanese culture and its unique sonic world — a world that completely fascinated him and became the heart of his artistic vision. In 2020, The Sun Vanished project was born, blending raw emotion, cinematic energy, and Japanese-inspired atmospheres into powerful bass music.\n\nSince then, TSV has released with respected labels such as Subcarbon Records, Raving Panda Records, Future Bass, Hybrid Trap, Trap City, and Crowsnest, carving his own path in the global bass scene.\n\nFor him, music isn’t about trends or expectations — it’s about emotion, instinct, and truth.\n\nHe creates what he feels, and he will always continue to do just that.",
